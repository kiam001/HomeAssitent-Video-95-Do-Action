It's all for me. You need to edit your lamp and Homeassistant settings.

The idea was: Turn all the lights on dimly and turn the others on with my beamer wand, so that when you pause, you can see some of the lights in your room.
Fade the light to 95% when the video ends and turn on the lamp behind your home cinema.

I need Android integration to control the on/off state.

I need Chromecast status to be enabled always to get the player state.

It doesn't work with Kodi; you need an extra script, KodiPlayer.yml.
